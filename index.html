        <p>Planning for retirement is essentially a closed system. Given three of the four parameters above, it is
            possible to solve for the fourth. That is not to say that there are not other factors that will affect
            retirement though. For instance, if you were to suddenly inherit a small fortune, that will obviously
            affect your options. This calculator should instead be used as a rule of thumb and a way to tinker with
            your financial situation and see how that affects your options.</p>
        <p>Overall, this is a slightly conservative estimate. It assumes an <b>8% annual return</b> in the stock
            market. Since inception, the stock market has provided an annualized return of 10.12%, and over the last
            20 and 25 years, the stock market has returned 9.86% and 9.62% respectively. So, it would seem safe to
            estimate at least a 9.5% return, and it probably is, but this doesn't account for bad luck. At times the
            10-year annualized return has dipped below 0% and the 15-year annualized return have come dangerously
            close. This calculator obviously cannot predict the stock market, instead it aims to insure financial
            security is the maximum percentage of environments. Therefore, 8% is used instead of 9.5%.</p>
        <p>Inflation becomes a little more difficult to calculate. This calculator assumes <b>3.5% annual
            inflation</b>. The average since the US government began tracking it in 1913 has been 3.22%. However,
            inflation actualy appears to be less sporadic than the stock market. One would think that makes it easier
            to find a safe estimate, but because our portfolios may only exist for twenty or thirty years, the
            inflation could be negative for their entire life span or as high as 5%. Again, this calculator assumes a
            slightly more conservative average to insure that a portfolio will survive the maximum percentage of
            environments. After subtracting annual inflation from annual returns, we arrive at the <b>4.5% annual rate
                of return</b> that is used.</p>
        <p>The calculator also assumes a <b>safe withdrawal rate of 4%.</b> Personally, I consider this a very safe
            withdrawal rate. Maybe the only estimate I consider too conservative in this calculator, and also the
            number that affects the calculations the most. If you assume that a portfolio will have a real
            return of 4.5% and a withdrawal rate of 4%, you will actually have more money at the end of your life
            than your retired with. If your goal is to pass away with $0 in the bank, you could probably withdrawal
            more than that.</p>
